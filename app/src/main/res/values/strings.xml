If r is odd, go back to Step 2 and choose a different value of k.\n
in our case  r = ToBeReplace1 is even, so we move on.</string>

Define p = remainder in (r/2)th transformation.\n\n
        If p + 1 = N, then go back to Step 2 and choose a different value of k.\n\n
        If not, proceed to Step 7.\n\n

This is the final step. The factors of N are \n\n
                f₁ = GCD (p+1, N)\n\n
                f₂ = GCD (p-1, N)\n\n
